My name is Joseph Wilson and I love how Data driven the world has become, I believe making structure from that organized chaos is my calling.

### My history
I started my interest into technology and programming during high school I worked as an assistant PC Technician to my school's network administrator for one year prior to stating school and up until he moved to a different role within the school system, my freshman year I taught myself some basic C++ and moved onto java GUI's, as high school when on my goals changed and I enlisted into the USMC, after getting out of the USMC I decided that I should follow some career that aligned with my technical knowledge and went into general contracting and construction which I worked for 4 years, the company that I worked for was a privately owned company and did not have any sort of career advancement opportunities so I shifted my career to the food service industry which I currently work in today, I'm currently one of the managers at a Pizza restaurant chain and became intrigued by the amount of data that we accumulate and aggregate from our customers on a daily basis. I wanted to understand that data better so that I can help my company become more efficient at its duties as well as become a better company to order from and work for. I never lost my passion for programing and continued to play with different concepts and languages throughout my adult life in my free time.

### Something that has stuck with me through the years....
 My first hint to the data science career path was actually something my mother told me years ago, I asked her "what do you think I am naturally good at doing?" her answer came almost instantly 'you are extremely good at looking at abstract information and parsing a meaning from it' at that moment I didn't know how that was going to help me in my job search but what she said has stuck with me even today.
